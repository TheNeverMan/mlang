# MLang
MLang is a really minimalistic esoteric programming language. Programs are heavily space limited as interpreter accepts them in form of 8x8 bitmaps.
Rest of readme will appear later.
# Docs
File `docs/docs.txt` contains full language specifitcation and explanation of all commands.
In `sample-programs` directory there are few sample programs written by me that show (underwhelming) capabilities of this language.
# Building
To build interpreter execute `make` in `src` directory. To run interpreter execute `./mlangc`.
